This Python project models air travel by creating Airport and Flight objects from input files, allowing for the querying and analysis of flight data. Key features include searching for flights by city or country, identifying direct or connecting flights, finding the shortest flight from an origin airport, and retrieving return flights. The program uses a dictionary to store flights by airport code and includes methods for comparing airports and managing errors. The Airport class handles attributes like airport code, city, and country with getter and setter methods.
